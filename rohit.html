        Rohit Sharma made his international debut in an ODI against Ireland on June 23, 2007.
        Though he didn’t get a chance to bat in that match, he made his presence felt in subsequent games.
         His breakthrough moment came during the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup, where he played a crucial role in India's victorious
          campaign. His 50* off 40 balls in a must-win match against South Africa and an impactful knock in the final
           against Pakistan showcased his temperament under pressure.
        Despite early promise, Rohit struggled with inconsistency in the initial years. He was in and out of the Indian team
         due to a lack of significant performances and was even left out of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup squad. 
         This setback fueled his determination, and he went back to domestic cricket, working tirelessly to improve his game.
          His patience and hard work paid off when he was promoted to open the innings in ODIs in 2013, a move that changed his
           career forever.

        Rohit Sharma took over India’s full-time captaincy in 2022, following Virat Kohli’s resignation.
         His calm and composed approach to leadership, coupled with his tactical acumen, has been widely appreciated.
          Under his captaincy, India won the Asia Cup 2018, reached the ICC World Test Championship final (2023),
           and played a dominant role in the 2023 ODI World Cup, finishing as runners-up.
        Rohit’s leadership style is different from his predecessors; he is known for backing his players, 
        making smart tactical decisions, and handling pressure situations with ease. His ability to absorb pressure
         and guide young talents has been crucial in India’s success across formats.

        Rohit Sharma married Ritika Sajdeh in December 2015. Ritika, a sports manager, has been a constant pillar of 
        support in his life. The couple welcomed their daughter, Samaira Sharma, in 2018. Rohit is known for being a
         family-oriented person and often shares glimpses of his personal life on social media.
       Apart from cricket, Rohit is actively involved in social causes, especially wildlife conservation. He has been a 
       vocal advocate for animal rights and has worked with organizations like WWF and PETA to raise awareness about
        endangered species.

         One of Rohit Sharma’s most outstanding achievements is being the first and only cricketer to score three double
         centuries in One Day Internationals. His first double century came in 2013 against Australia (209 runs). A year
         later, he shattered records with an astonishing 264 runs against Sri Lanka, the highest individual score in ODI
         history. In 2017, he scored his third double century (208* vs Sri Lanka), cementing his reputation as one of the    
         greatest ODI batsmen.
         Rohit’s performance in the 2019 ICC World Cup was nothing short of legendary. He became the first player in World 
         Cup history to score five centuries in a single tournament, finishing as the highest run-scorer with 648 runs in 9 
         matches. His consistency and ability to dominate top bowling attacks were key to India’s strong campaign in the tournament.
         As the captain of Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Rohit has been one of the most successful 
         leaders in franchise cricket. Under his captaincy, MI has won five IPL titles (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020), making
         him the most successful IPL captain alongside MS Dhoni. His leadership, calm demeanor, and match-winning performances 
         have made MI a powerhouse in the IPL.
         In 2017, Rohit Sharma equaled David Miller’s record for the fastest T20I century, scoring a hundred off just 35 balls 
         against Sri Lanka. This knock included an incredible display of power-hitting and stroke play, showcasing his ability 
         to dominate the shortest format of the game.
         Although initially overlooked in Test cricket, Rohit proved his mettle when he was given the opportunity as an opener
         in 2019. He started with back-to-back centuries against South Africa and has since become an integral part of India’s 
         Test setup. His performances in overseas conditions, especially in England and Australia, have silenced his critics.

       Rohit Sharma’s journey from a young boy with dreams in Nagpur to becoming the captain of the Indian cricket team is 
       truly inspiring. His records, achievements, and leadership have solidified his place among cricketing greats.
       With multiple world records, IPL dominance, and an ever-growing fan base, he is not just a cricketer but a role model
       for aspiring players.
       As he continues to lead India and score runs across formats, cricket fans eagerly await more breathtaking performances
       from the Hitman. His legacy will be remembered as one of the greatest batsmen and captains in Indian cricket history.
